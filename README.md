# Build a CLI RubyGem with External Data

## Overview

In this lesson you're going to build a RubyGem that provides a CLI interface to an external data source. Your code will be packaged as a RubyGem and install a CLI for the user. The CLI will be composed of an Objected Oriented Ruby application

## Requirements

1. Package as a gem
2. Provide a CLI on gem installation.
3. CLI must provide data from an external source, whether scraped or via a public API.
4. Data provided must go at least a level deep, generally by showing the user a list of available data and then being able to drill into a specific item.

how to build a gem resources
publish to rubygems.


example domains
1. movies opening soon
  list opening movies
  get detailed info about opening movie

2. libraries near you
  enter zipcode
  list libraries
  library details

3. advaned student CLI
  - list twitter accounts
  - global twitter feed
  - global blog feed
  - interactive twitter

4. programming meetups near you
    list meetups
    details

5. news reader
  list articles
  read article



## Instructions

Create a new repository on github for your gem

name-cli-gem
mta-status-cli-gem
buzzfeed-cli-gem
new-hackernews-cli-gem

submit that repo to the assessment immediately

build your gem there
record at least a 30 min coding session, narrate or not. keep it, if we ask for it youll have to provide it.

submit a video of your working gem.
submit the final code
write a blog post about the project and process

schedule your pairing session.
  be prepared to:
    1. Explain your code from execution point to exit point. We're making sure you wrote it and understand how it works, nothing else. 5-10 minutes

    2. write tests together. you'll be responsible for making tests pass, not writing test code. however, you'll be expected to provide expected return data of methods. you'll need to know how your code should work, not rspec or testing. 20-30 minutes

    3. refactor code. 20-30 minutes

    4. extend the application. a new feature. more data. a different domain. 20-30 minutes

    5. submit an improved version

    6. write a README.md

  what to expect:
    articulate code
    use the best vocabulary you can
    listen to corrections
    trust yourself
    trust us
    think on your feet
    look things up
    implement new concepts on the fly
    explain the details
    learn a ton
    be pushed to the edge of your knowledge
    be support
    whatever you don't quite understand will be explained

  what won't happen:
    you won't be told you're ever wrong
    you won't be yelled at, belittled, or scolded
    you won't be put on the spot without support
    there's nothing you can do to instantly fail or blow it.
